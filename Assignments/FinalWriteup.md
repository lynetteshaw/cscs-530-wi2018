# Final Writeup

### Due Thursday, April 24, 2018 (submitted through Canvas -- may use GitHub for model related files if easier)

&nbsp; 

For this final assignment, I will need:

1) __The writeup__ - I anticipate this will likely be 10-15 pages, but shorter or longer is fine so long as you fully cover all the elements described below. PDF is preferred.
2) __Your model__ - I should be able to both review the code and run it myself. (_Issues with PyCX backend not withstanding -I'll try to handle such on my own if that comes up_)

&nbsp; 


### What to Cover in the Writeup

For inspiration, or just to get an idea of what you would want to aim for if you were submitting a paper based on your model for publication, 
see the readings on the [Overview, Design concepts, and Details](https://github.com/lynetteshaw/cscs-530-wi2017/blob/master/Readings/ODD_update.pdf)
[(ODD)](https://github.com/lynetteshaw/cscs-530-wi2017/blob/master/Readings/ODD_update.pdf) Protocol.

You _do not_ need to provide as thorough an overview for this final writeup as described, but it's not a bad thing to have in mind.

#### Problem Overview and Literature Review

Explain what your model is getting at and why ABM is a useful approach to the problem. Provide an overview of some of the literature 
related to the substantive issue and prior related modeling work. Feel free to borrow heavily from what you submitted in your 
Project Brainstorm assignment.


#### Model Description

Describe how your model works in terms of its 

1) agents
2) interaction topology 
3) environment (if applicable)
4) model schedule. 

Feel free to borrow and modify what you submitted in your model proposal. Looking at how this is handled in the ODD Protocol readings might 
provide some good inspiration.

#### Model Results and Analysis

Describe the parameter settings you swept through. Provide qualitative and quantitative summaries of how your model behaves 
across many individual trials at the same parameter settings (see earlier lectures on model assessment). Provide graphs and plots 
of model outcomes at different settings as needed.


#### Discussion and Future Work

Discuss what you got and how it might shed light on the substantive problem in which you are interested. If you suspect that there are still
some kinks or bugs that are driving some of your model's behavior, this would be a great place to discuss it. Feel free to discuss ideas
on how you would like to further verify, validate, or extend the model in future work here as well.
