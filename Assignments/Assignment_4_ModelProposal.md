# Assignment 4: Model Proposal
## **Due Tues., 3/6 via your GitHub Repository**
&nbsp; 

For this proposal, fill out the sections provided in the [Model Proposal Template](https://github.com/lynetteshaw/cscs-530-wi2018/blob/master/Assignments/ModelProposalTemplate.md).
You will need to submit it to me via your own GitHub repository. To get started with that and to find out more about the Markdown format you will be working with, 
see the provided [GitHub Overview](https://github.com/lynetteshaw/cscs-530-wi2018/blob/master/GitHub_Overview.md).

Once completed, you can either just provide me a link to the repository or add me ([lynetteshaw](https://github.com/lynetteshaw)) as a collaborater. The second option is preferable as it will make
it easier for me to give you feedback directly on the proposal you submit, but it's ultimately up to your preference.

Some additional notes:

* Please note that unless you opt to pay for your GitHub repository, whatever you post to it will be publically available (but unlikely to be viewed widely unless you go around sending
the link to people). If you foresee having an issue with this now or in future submissions for this project, let me know.

* If you are feeling particularly ambitious and plan to develop your model using Jupyter notebook, feel free to submit your proposal in that format.
