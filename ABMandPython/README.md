# ABM and Python

There are a variety of approaches to developing ABM in Python. In this course, we'll be focusing on the use of the [PyCX project](http://pycx.sourceforge.net/) resources and the "rolling your own" Python models approach taken in [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity/). There are many ways to approach this task, however, and I encourage you to explore and find out what works best for you.

A nice overview and discussion of the resources we will be using, as well as others, for getting started with ABM in Python is available at [Simulating Complexity - Starting with Python](https://simulatingcomplexity.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/python/).
