    "### HIV Model Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "  We will examine policy interventation strategies to address and control the spread of HIV in a sexual network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "  Given the heterogeneity of behavior and network effects of sexually-transmitted diseases, this problem requires ABM and network methodology.  Differential equation compartment models will not allow for incomplete or scale-free graph structures or time-varying agent behavior, and so cannot be used.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Implement condom subsidy mechanics\n",
    "  * Vary condom subsidy \n",
    "  * Observe number of steps to 50% infected\n",
    "  * Observe the mean and standard deviation of sexual partner degree distribution\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "To formally describe our model, let's break it down into pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Space\n",
    "  In this model, our space will be a two-dimensional (2D) square grid.  Each grid cell will contain zero or one people.  Edges of the grid will wrap around.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. People\n",
    " In this case, people are the carriers of HIV.  We are modeling them as simply as possible, using only the following properties:\n",
    " \n",
    " ** Properties **\n",
    "   * _is_infected_: is the person infected with HIV?\n",
    "   * _condom_budget_: what is the person's budget for protection?\n",
    "   * _prob_hookup_: what is the probability that a person will want to hookup given contact?\n",
    "   \n",
    "For their step function, agents will perform the following:\n",
    " \n",
    "   * take a unit-distance step in a random direction\n",
    "   * evaluate neighboring cells for any potential people to hookup with\n",
    "   * for each pair, check against _prob_hookup_; if both people sample True, then hookup\n",
    "   * for a hookup, check against _max_budget_ and the global condom cost to see if either partner will purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Institution\n",
    "\n",
    "  A \"public health\" institution will manage the level of subsidy for condoms.  For now, the subsidy level will be set at $t_0$ and constant over model run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. People\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * People will be randomly distributed throughout the grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement.  In the event that an agent has already been placed at the sampled location, we continue drawing a new random position until it is unoccupied.\n",
    "  * People will have their ``prob_hookup`` randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  * People will have their ``condom_budget`` randomly initialized to a value from a uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  * A single person will be selected at random at $t_0$ to have HIV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Insitution\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The public health institution will set a level of subsidy for condoms using a random uniform continuous distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### IV. Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "  Based on the description above, we need the following model parameters:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * ``grid_size``: size of the two-dimensional square grid, i.e., dimension length\n",
    "  * ``num_people``: number of persons to create; must be less than ${grid\\_size}^2$\n",
    "  * ``min_subsidy``, ``max_subsidy``: the lower and upper bounds for the institution's subsidy\n",
    "  * ``min_condom_budget``, ``max_condom_budget``: the lower and upper bounds for initial conditions of people's ``condom_budget``\n",
    "  * ``condom_cost``: cost of a condom; fixed to $1.0$\n",
    "  * ``min_prob_hookup``, ``max_prob_hookup``: the lower and upper bounds for initial conditions of people's ``prob_hookup``\n",
    "  * ``prob_transmit``, ``prob_transmit_condom``: the probability of transmitting the disease without and with a condom"
