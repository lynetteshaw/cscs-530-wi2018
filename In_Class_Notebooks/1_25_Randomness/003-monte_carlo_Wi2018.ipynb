    "  If you're recall the section on __algorithmic complexity__ from [Chapter 3 of our Thinking Complexity book](http://www.greenteapress.com/compmod/html/thinkcomplexity004.html), you might notice that our \"fastest\" method appears to have a run time that doesn't vary with ``initial_resource``, whereas the \"normal\" and \"fast\" methods do.  In this case, we have an algorithm that is linear with ``max_steps`` but constant with respect to all other parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In general, we cannot always implement simulations in this fashion.  However, here are a few hints or restatements that you might be able to improve your simulation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * you sample many values from a random distribution whose parameters are __constant__ or __stationary__\n",
    "  * you __do not__ have state-dependence in the sampling of your random variables\n",
    "  * you can represent your step dynamics using vector or matrix operations, e.g., element-wise or cumulative arithmetic like addition or multiplication"
